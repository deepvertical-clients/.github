## Ethos

- We design and deliver bespoke financial AI systems that run inside your perimeter - and we transfer 100% of the IP. 

- Our VERA reference architecture (not a product) orchestrates state-of-the-art models (currently Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5), and a private on-prem model (currently gpt-oss-20b on RTX 5090) to orchestrate financial agents and process financial workflows at institutional standards. 

- With hybrid routing, sensitive data never leaves your environment; with triple grounding and audit-grade logs, outcomes are verifiable. We deploy, hand over complete source, train your team, and step back. You own everything - no subscriptions, no dependencies, no lock-in.
